# Project Palooza - Pogo
Project for making a pogo-jumping robot.

More to come later!

CS TODO:
  - Set up Raspberry Pi
    - Figure out how it interfaces with motors (I/O of both motor control and sensors)
    - Control system: RC vs Wifi etc
    - Justin to future Justin: I'm currently on step 2 of the lab guide rn, recheck if the patch application (merge) was ok
  - PID:
     - Constant time loop(? ask henry what that means later)
     - Figure out how to better reset data (especially Integral term)
