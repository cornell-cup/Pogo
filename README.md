# Project Palooza - Pogo
Arduino code for the INU and Encoder.

The INU we are using is the ["9DOF Sensor Stick" version "SEN-10724"](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/retired/10724).
The code base currently in use is pulled from [here](https://github.com/Razor-AHRS/razor-9dof-ahrs/wiki/Tutorial#setting-up-the-hardware)

The INU is not compatible with the Arduino Yun.
The INU works with the Arduino Mega.
